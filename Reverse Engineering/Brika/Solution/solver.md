First we should start our static analysis , i used JADX to decompile the apk and analyse the source code 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbd66f3a-6a47-4abc-994e-955ed32c7b20)

We found that there is a check function on the hash of the secret string,

```
840bcbee48aa77500b2d09e4ffc761b890cce99e2137c00ee8934f4d1c42a12b
```
so we should carck it

the secret string was not found 

so we should patch this app

First,

we should use apk tool to build this app

In smali code 

```
if-eqz = if
if-nez = if not
```
Now we should rebuild the apk

After that we should sign it

Finaly the code source was modified

So we will put a random string
