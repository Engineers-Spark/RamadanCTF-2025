To solve this challenge, the user must:

Understand the Functions:

Analyze countWays, tribo, cha9an, and faza to determine their outputs for specific inputs.

Tribo  : This function calculates the n-th Tribonacci number using memoization (a dynamic programming technique).

CountWays : This function calculates the number of ways to climb n stairs, where you can take either 1 step or 2 steps at a time.

It uses a recursive approach similar to the Fibonacci sequence.

Calculate the Required Values:

Compute faza("DolmaDessertDuckCouscousCakeC") to get "D21C".

Compute cha9an(10) to get "0011247132444".

Compute countWays(5) to get 8.
